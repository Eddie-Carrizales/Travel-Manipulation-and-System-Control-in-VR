# Travel-Manipulation-and-System-Control-in-VR
Implemented Travel, Manipulation, and System Control techniques in Virtual Reality using Google Cardboard.

Description: Developed a character capable of dynamic movement, including looking around, various travel speeds, and teleportation. Additionally, implemented a raycasting mechanism that highlights five designated objects in the scene when pointed at. Leveraging the raycast, players can interact with these objects by moving, copying, and pasting them. The length of the raycast is adjustable, allowing for precise interactions. Furthermore, introduced both action-first and object-first menus for streamlined access to different object functionalities.

Note: This runs on Android 6.0+ or later. Additionally, I used a simple Bluetooth joystick for character travel as well as the use of buttons. If you plan to use this project, you may need to re-map the buttons under Unity Project Settings.
